Property Development Scheme
===========================

Abstract
--------

Prior to 2002, foreign nationals were not allowed to purchase property
in Mauritius. This changed with the advent of the Integrated Resort
Scheme (IRS). The Real Estate Scheme (RES) was then launched to tackle
some deficiencies within the IRS. Finally, the most recent incarnation
is the Property Development Scheme (PDS) and is the subject of this
tokenization. This has the least stringent terms of all the aforementioned
schemes.
